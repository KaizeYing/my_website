    subtitle: "
    Besides my academic interets in novel materials and professional interests in investing, I have spent a large amount of time exploring different things.
      \n  For example, I enjoy cooking, travelling, moutain-climbing, and used to take a train trip back from London to my hometown in China.
      \n  I also used to be quite actively involved in the Oxford Union back to my undergraduate.
      \n  Feel free to reach out if we have something in common so that we can have a chat :)      "
